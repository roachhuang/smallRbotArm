# smallRbotArm
This project is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFCUw1pXlnA&list=RDCMUCcgqJ1blFKqbC2bWGY4Opmg&index=5

Here are the changes i made to make it more flexible:
    1. pull inverse kinematic and foward kinematic from Simple6Dof_Ver2.ino to python so that we can control the robot arm from PC by sending poses of end-effect to arudino through usb port.

    2. an python UI built by chatGPT to control the robot, also plot
        the robot movemnt in real-time. it is amazing!

    3. implement trajectory planning (linear function with parabolic blends) learned from https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics1/lecture/EddnO/7-3-gui-ji-gui-hua-shi-li-fang-fa-er
    I set 2 via points in my program between init and final points.
    the robot arm will move to those points at designated time. this project took me lots of time to make it work and the outcome is acceptable. This project is very cool.

    4. set up an antique 3d camera (xbox 360) above the robot, use it to capture the image of an object on the table, compute the object's coordinate (x, y and z), transfer it into the robot's base frame, move the robot arm to pick it up accroding to the transferred coordinate. 

outstanding issues:
    use g-code decoder to interface btw py and arduino instead of using propiertary 
G90 ; Set absolute coordinates
G28 ; Home all axes
G1 X100 Y100 Z100 A45 B45 C45 F1000 ; Move to position (100, 100, 100) with orientation (45, 45, 45)
In this example, we first set the coordinate system to absolute coordinates using G90. Then we home all axes using G28. Finally, we move the robot arm to position (100, 100, 100) with orientation (45, 45, 45) using G1.

In the Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB, the reach function computes the workspace of a robot and returns the result in units that are consistent with the robot's kinematic model. The units used depend on the specific robot model and can vary depending on the configuration and parameters of the robot.

For example, if the robot is modeled using the standard Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, the reach function will return the workspace in units of meters. If the robot is modeled using the modified DH (MDH) parameters, the reach function will return the workspace in units of millimeters.

It is important to note that the reach function returns the workspace in the coordinate system defined by the robot's kinematic model, which may not be the same as the world frame or any other external coordinate system. If you need to convert the workspace coordinates to a different unit or coordinate system, you will need to perform a coordinate transformation using the appropriate transformation matrices.

The reach function in the Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB returns a vector of six values representing the reachability of the robot in six degrees of freedom (DOF). Each value in the vector corresponds to the maximum distance that the robot's end-effector can reach along a particular axis of motion.

The six values in the vector represent the reachability along the X, Y, and Z axes of the robot's base frame, as well as the roll, pitch, and yaw axes of the end-effector. By computing the maximum reach along each of these axes, the reach function can determine the overall workspace of the robot in all six degrees of freedom.

It is important to note that the reachability values returned by the reach function are relative to the robot's base frame and are dependent on the specific configuration and parameters of the robot model. Additionally, the actual reachability of the robot may be affected by factors such as joint limits, collisions with obstacles in the environment, or other operational constraints. Therefore, the reachability values returned by the reach function should be used as a rough estimate of the robot's capabilities and should be validated through physical testing and simulation.

Many industrial robot arms are designed with the axis 4 and 5 origins intersecting at the same point. This configuration is commonly known as a "wrist flip" or "flip wrist" configuration.

The main advantage of this configuration is that it allows the robot to achieve a wider range of motion and more precise movements, particularly when working in tight spaces or manipulating objects with complex geometries. In addition, it simplifies the control of the robot arm, as the axis 4 and 5 joints can be treated as a single joint in the robot's kinematic model.

However, there are also some drawbacks to the wrist flip configuration. One disadvantage is that it can result in a less stable end effector orientation, particularly when the robot is carrying heavy payloads or performing high-speed movements. In addition, the wrist flip configuration can make it more difficult to route cables and hoses through the robot arm, which can increase the risk of interference and damage.

Overall, the wrist flip configuration is a popular choice for industrial robot arms due to its advantages in terms of flexibility and precision. However, it is important to carefully consider the specific application requirements and constraints when selecting a robot arm configuration.

In the code I provided, self.__d_deg*(elapsed_time/5) is used to determine how much the needle should be rotated based on the elapsed time since the last update.

self.__d_deg is the speed of rotation, measured in degrees per second. Multiplying it by elapsed_time gives the amount of rotation that should have occurred since the last update, measured in degrees. Dividing this by 5 scales the rotation so that it appears smooth, regardless of the framerate of the animation. The value of 5 is somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted depending on how fast or slow you want the animation to appear.

in your case, frames is not used?
ChatGPT
In the code I provided earlier, the frames variable is used as a parameter for the animation.FuncAnimation() method. This is because FuncAnimation() requires a function that returns the current frame at each step of the animation.

In the example code I provided, the update() function returns the current frame as an artist object at each step, and this is passed as the frames parameter to FuncAnimation(). The frames parameter is used by FuncAnimation() to determine how long to run the animation for (based on the number of frames) and to generate the animation.

So, in short, frames is used in the background by FuncAnimation() to create the animation, but it's not directly used in the update() function.







User
frame decases by one for each time update func is called?
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. In the update function, the frame value is decremented by 1 for each call, which makes the animation move to the next frame. This is achieved with the line self.frame = (self.frame - 1) % len(self.frames).

The modulus operator % is used to ensure that the frame value stays within the range of valid indices for the self.frames list. Once the frame value reaches 0, it will wrap around to the end of the list and the animation will start over.
